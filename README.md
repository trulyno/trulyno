I'm a second-year Computer Science student at the State University of Moldova. I've been passionate about computers since I was a small child, and now I'm studying to create my own apps and projects. One of my biggest successes is my Minecraft modpack, **Star Technology**, which has gained over a quarter of a million downloads!
